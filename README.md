## What is Shop + ?

Shop plus is an online shopping service/app that gives the client the liberty of buying anything from the comfort of their homes without needing to leave. Also, Shop + not only gives you the option to buy online products, but also Physical items that are not found within your residence area/state!

## What was our motivation?

Our motivation was mainly to work on the idea of the various intricacies that follow making an online shopping service. Also, this project has helped us as developers work on new and different Python libraries, as well as give us a detailed insight of how companies model their respective work sheets and ideas with UML. We studied a range of concepts, as well as diagrams that help clarify the idea of our project, using modeling language.

## Programming language, Development Environment, and Libraries used:
