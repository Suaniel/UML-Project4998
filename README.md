## What is Shop + ?

Shop plus is an online shopping service/app that gives the client the liberty of buying anything from the comfort of their homes without needing to leave. Also, Shop + not only gives you the option to buy online products, but also Physical items that are not found within your residence area/state!

## What was our motivation?

Our motivation was mainly to work on the idea of the various intricacies that follow making an online shopping service. Also, this project has helped us as developers work on new and different Python libraries, as well as give us a detailed insight of how companies model their respective work sheets and ideas with UML. We studied a range of concepts, as well as diagrams that help clarify the idea of our project, using modeling language.

## Programming language, Development Environment, and Libraries used:

We made set our sights in developing this project using Python and Python libraries. These Libraries were Pandas, Pillow, and Tkinter modules. We also developed our code in the VSCODE IDE, in a Linux environment.

## System Requirements:

* Have Python 3 installed
  * Pillow module installed
  * Tkinter module installed

## Notes about usage and instructions:
- In order to sign into the program, the user needs to fill the username entry box with "customer" and the password entry box with "pass" in the login screen.
  - The text "customer" and "pass" can be either lowercased or uppercased, either will grant entry to the user.
- Once in the Main screen, the user can access any other screen in the program via the drop-down menu box in the top left corner of the screen.
- Choosing a product can either be incremented or decremented with the spinwheel besides the number box that's besides it, or entering the number manually.
  - The amount entered/chosen cannot exceed the current amount shown right beside the price of the product.
- Once the amount of desired products have been added to the cart, user can either buy or cancel the purchase.
- **Note**: if user cancels the amount of products added, **ALL** products in the cart will be refunded back to their original state.
- Given that the user buys items, those said products will be displayed in the Order screen that can also be accessed from the drop-down menu mentioned earlier.
  - Any bought products will have their "current availability" reduced by the amount that was chosen in the purchase screen upon purchasing them in the Cart screen.
- If user wants to close the program, they may either do it with the button "log out" in the drop-down menu or closing the window.
